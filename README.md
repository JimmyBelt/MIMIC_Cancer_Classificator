## Case strudy: Cancer Classification in Clinical data from the MIMIC-II database for a case study on indwelling arterial catheters

The main objective of this case study is to achieve a model capable of identifying whether a patient has a malignant tumour or not from demographic data, clinical observations and other outcomes.

This project also aims to show my skills and competences in Machine Learning and the world of data, to demonstrate my experience programming in Python and to document my progress.
